## Group 5 Week 3: Group homework
Add Scripts and tests to the two required contracts for tokenised voting, to implement:
- voting rights,
- casting votes,
- delegating votes (and)
- querying results

These scripts should not have a dependency on hardhat.

Note that contracts/Ballot.sol is *not* our (Group 5's) work; it came from the hardhat base project 

# Base was lesson 12:
This had deployment scripts and the two contracts.
